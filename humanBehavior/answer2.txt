Welcome, User!
This Chatbot is made to create an Ontology.
I will ask you questions about the ontology and you have to answer them.
Let's start!!

In which file shall I save the ontology?
IMPORTANT: If the file path is local then it has to begin with file://
           If the file path is digital then it has to begin with http://
> the file is file:////media/akis/Ubuntu-Windows/Uni/Chatbot-for-Ontology-Generation/ontologies/ChatBot2.owl

What questions do you want your ontology to be able to answer?
> enumerate the horse of the town

Shall I search for the definition of  "horse"?
> yes

The Ontology "ncit" has the following description for "horse":
The domestic horse, Equus caballus.
Shall I keep this ontology with a description?
If the answer is negative then this Ontology will be discarded and another Ontology will be searched.
> no

The Ontology "foodon" has no description for "horse".
Should I keep this ontology without a description?
If the answer is negative then this Ontology will be discarded and another Ontology will be searched.
> yes

Shall I keep the Kids of "horse"?
> yes

The Ontology "foodon" has "mule" as kid of "horse" with the description:
A mule is the offspring of a male donkey and a female horse. Horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes. Of the two F1 hybrids between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a hinny (the offspring of a male horse and a female donkey). All male mules and most female mules are infertile.
Shall I keep this kid?
> yes

Shall I search for the definition of  "town"?
> yes

I have not found an ontology with that label!
Do you want to give your own definition for  "town"?
> yes

What is your definition of  "town"?
> Athens

Do you want the ontology to be able to answer more questions?
> no

Do you want to enumerate the different types of words in the ontology?
IMPORTANT: If the answer is negative then the program will finish here and the ontology will be saved!

I would like to thank you for using this ChatBot to develop your ontology!
