Welcome, User!
This Chatbot is made to create an Ontology.
I will ask you questions about the ontology and you have to answer them.
Let's start!!

In which file shall I save the ontology?
IMPORTANT: If the file path is local then it has to begin with file://
           If the file path is digital then it has to begin with http://
> the file is file:////media/akis/Ubuntu-Windows/Uni/Chatbot-for-Ontology-Generation/ontologies/ChatBot.owl

What questions do you want your ontology to be able to answer?
> enumerate all kinds of remote sensors used in satellites

Lemmatize the "kinds" to "kind"
Lemmatize the "sensors" to "sensor"
Lemmatize the "satellites" to "satellite"

Shall I search for the definition of  "kind"?
> I do not want to search.

Do you want to give your own definition for  "kind"?
> No, I do not want to give a Definition.

Shall I keep  "kind" without a definition?
If the answer is negative then the ontology will not keep this word.
> No

Shall I search for the definition of  "remote sensor"?
> yes

I have not found an ontology with that label!
Do you want to give your own definition for  "remote sensor"?
