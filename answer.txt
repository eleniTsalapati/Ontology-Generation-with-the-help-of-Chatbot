Welcome, User!
This Chatbot is made to create an Ontology.
I will ask you questions about the ontology and you have to answer them.
Let's start!!

In which file shall I save the ontology?
IMPORTANT: If the file path is local then it has to begin with file://
           If the file path is digital then it has to begin with http://
